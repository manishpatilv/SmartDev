#AndroidDevChallenge

As per challenge give 

The Smart Assistant Android application is about filling out the application so that it can work offline and online.
There are a lot of options out there, but some of the most important ones are the ones below
1)At first, I thought it was possible to convert a language into a language now, but instead of doing we need to put more emphasis on his grammaticality.
(In Linux system understands word and grammatical words difference. )

2)The second moment is that the more you pay attention to their language, the more attention they get to the symbolic language.For example, if I want tea, click on the button that says "Tea"  or "restaurant" otherwise I will not do it as a tea or coffee searching in search box.
We all understood the symbols used in speech rather than just understanding that there are many languages ​​in the world.
(Presentation or UI of application is like non fonatic it's must graphical icon that has meaning)

3)The third thing is that if we save a person's geolocation and undo the data near it, it can work well even offline.In it you will find the road , bank, restaurant, school, tourist destination ,railway station.
We can also add offline language to sit down so he can have a conversation there.
(Like Google map store sptial data )

All above thoughts  are integrite in one application .. give us smart dev 
..

Thanks you to give chance to participate in challenge.. and present my thoughts.
